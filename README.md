This is a simple To Do List App that i create using only HTML CSS and JavaScript. <br/>
To try this by yourself, Clone this repository to your desktop and open the File using Code Editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code) <br/> and start it using Live Server Extensions.
For those who hasn't had a Live Server Extensions, you can install it in VS Code.
